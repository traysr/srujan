Apple released iBooks 2 yesterday. All my wishes about [Smart Books](/smartbooks) and [Smart Text Books](/smarttextbooks) are fulfilled in iBooks 2.

For long time, I was fascinated by the presentation in various books from _Dorling Kindersley_, better known as [dk books](http://www.dk.co.uk/). I have also loved the presentation in _Art History_ Books and _Encyclopedias_. From the time I got my iPad, I have always [wondered](/8/the-dinner-plate-we-never-had) how the consuption device experience can be made more interactive and intimate. A more deeper thinking led to the articles I mentioned above about Smart Books and Smart Text Books. I had plans about making an interactive _Art History App_ before I developed [Tactilis](http://www.tactilisapp.com).

I am also inspired by the [Our Choice](http://pushpoppress.com/ourchoice/) app from _push pop press_. The developers behind Our Choice are some of the best designer-developers I have seen. I especially follow the work of [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/). 

It is no secret that iBooks 2 looks very much inspired by _Our Choice_. The format of Chapters and Sections accessible through bottom thumbnails is much like _Our Choice_, although Apple has also added a normal Book like page layout in Portrait mode.
I thought Apple would develop an iBook framework and release it to developers. The _iBooks Author_ is much more than I expected. It makes the platform more accessible to content creators and designers, rather than them needing to go via developers. Of-course, the designers would need developer help in developing nice interactivity. I also believe that Apple will slowly make the common interactions (like timelines, world maps etc) standard widgets in the app.

I am planning on making a nice interactive book and releasing it for free. This would give me an opportunity to design a book and also program some cool widgets in Dashcode, the two things that have been on my learning to-do list.
