_This article was written before tablets were accepted as useful devices. It seems dated now. Read it to get a glimpse of pre-tablet days._

When iPad was unveiled on Jan 27<sup>th</sup> I was following the live blogging of the event and a thought struck me. I felt that though it is a new device, it fulfills a very old need. The need that we had as early as the time when desktop computers were invented. I felt like we were living in a weird world where up until now nobody understood the basic need of such a device and nobody invented it. The world was as weird as the world where dinner plate was not invented.

Imagine this world without dinnerware. The people in this world do cook and eat food just like us and they do have very elaborate cuisine with lot of variety. They have well equipped kitchens and dining rooms, but till a few years back had no dinnerware. So what do they use for eating ? They simply use the cookware. Pots and pans are used for cooking and also for eating the food. It is not that these people are of any primitive kind. They have state of the art multipurpose cookware that can help make a wide variety of foods. “Why do we need a different utensil to eat food ?”, some of them say, as they feel the pots and pans are perfect for eating.

This world is not without problems. There are many people who are not cook-savvy and still need to eat food. They don’t know how to properly handle the cookware and get burnt while touching the hot surfaces. They don’t know the proper way of using spoons and forks in the teflon coated pans and sometimes accidentally scratch them. But who cares about the less cook-savvy people anyways. They can ruin their cookware as they wish or maybe use wooden spoons. Besides, the cookware is so cheap they can replace it every few months.

It is not true that these guys had no items specially made for eating food rather than making food. They did have cups and glasses, but there was no substitute for a nice frying pan if you want to eat your main course. It was about this time when a small plate, better known as saucer was invented. The saucer was a huge success. People liked the idea that it was flat and attractive and easy to clean. The less cook-savvy didn’t have to worry about spoiling the coating and there was no need of a proper way of using the forks. They could even eat the main course in it if they wish. They just had to eat small portions at a time.

Some cookware makers did understand the need of a cheap pan that was more suited for eating purpose. They made a small plastic pan called net-pan. The net-pan was not really suitable for eating as it had the handle, but the makers thought that just by reducing the size and making it cheap, a fry-pan could be used for eating and maybe for some light cooking. But then some weird guy thought that the net-pans are just a piece of junk and he came up with an idea of a Dinner Plate. He said the dinner plate fits between a saucer and a pan. Immediately, some started thinking it is a failed product. They said : “It is neither a saucer, nor a pan. What is the use of such an expensive item when you could not make an omelet in it ?”, while others thought “It is just a large saucer”. Many food and dining critiques are still contemplating the real use of this new object.

If you haven’t noticed, we have been living in such a weird world. Just replace the pots and pans with desktops and laptops and the saucer and dinner plate with smart-phone and iPad. We did have sufficient variety of computers to produce data and content, but had very few options to consume them, and among them was missing a device for large scale consumption of data.

Tomorrow, many people will get their first iPads (I am getting one at the end of this month). But it is quite possible that in a few months, the questions “Do we really need an iPad ?” might sound as absurd as “Do we really need a dinner plate ?”
