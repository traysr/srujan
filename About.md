#### Philosophy

Vision, is probably one of the most complex and interesting senses used by us for interacting with our environment. There are two primary categories of interaction. Interaction with the natural environment, guided by our primitive senses and the other is interaction with man made visual objects and information that is guided by a more non-primitive knowledge of language, culture, symbols etc.

When our brain processes the information conveyed by the written words, symbols and images, there is also a more primitive processing that analyses the form of words and symbols and the form of the objects on which they are printed or written. This primitive analyses conveys additional information (let us call it meta-information) to us even if the author of information had no intention of conveying it. This meta-information has a larger impact on how well we grasp the original information and store it.

The art of effectively conveying information in visual form goes by different names like painting, photography, graphic design, UI design, etc. We could club them all under a common name, visual interface design. This website, its blog and related resources are an attempt to better understand and use visual interface design principles. It focuses on inter disciplinary exchange of ideas between classical arts, and the more modern, technology based arts such as photography, computer graphics and graphical user interfaces.
