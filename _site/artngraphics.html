  <h1 class="post-title">Traditional Art and Computer Graphics</h1>
  <p>I have interest in both art and computer graphics, I find it surprising that the two fields follow quite separate paths even though they have a lot in common.</p>

<p>Computer Graphics theory seems to rediscover a lot of concepts and learnings that were already known by the great masters. On the other hand I feel, the classical atelier method could benefit from using 3d modeling applications as <em>tools</em> to assist learning the <em>form</em> and affect of light on it. 3d Computer Graphics provide an easier way to move arrange 3d objects and lights in different ways to learn different combinations of light and shade.</p>

<p>Part of the difference lies in the fact that computer graphics community is made up of two very separate roles for individuals. The <em>Application Developers</em> or <em>Programmers</em>, who are well trained in <em>3D Solid &amp; Surface Geometry</em> concepts, and the 3d artists, who are trained in using the applications to produce stills images and animations. On the other hand, in traditional art, both of these roles are combined into a single person, the painter.</p>

<p>Here is a list of observations. They are all separate bullet points that I am unable to put together in a good way</p>

<ul>
  <li>Painting is considered art while graphics is considered science. Although I believe both are somewhere in the middle.</li>
  <li>The basic principles of light are introduced in more approximate and practical ways in art books (in order to shade by hand), while they are taught as a collection of separate physical formulas (that can be written as mathematical equations). Although these separate ways are good for task at hand, I feel each of these books could borrow from each other. New art books could have a page devoted to three types of light effects (ambient, diffuse and specular), while the graphics books could devote a page on how the three effects would look in a combined and way, like the classical sphere made up of highlight/midtones/shadow/reflected light and cast shadow.</li>
  <li>In recent years, there is a lot of discussion in computer graphics community about a “newly” discovered concept called subsurface scattering that would make the rendering of skin and marble more realistic !!
I believe this concept of light scattering below the surface was well known to great masters as can be observed in their renditions of skin and marble in paintings. If only the graphics scientists would have read a bit about these and the methods used to render these effects they could have benefited a lot earlier. (I think it is produced by painting a lot of thin layers of paint one above another, that can in a way ‘trap’ the light and scatter it),</li>
  <li>I feel the online communities and discussions go totally separate ways in both the communities. When I visit the graphics communities I see, that the artists trying to learn anatomy are searching for information, and happy with some cheap books/dvds that are not accurate or well drawn.
There are many such instances, which I could crystallize to put in words.. I will keep adding them as I become more aware…</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, let me confess that while I am interested in both, I am more affectionate towards painting than graphics. I consider that as of today, the organic forms (portraits/figures/landscapes) produced by hand are much more accurate and also pleasing to eye than the ones produced using graphics applications. 
Yet I do feel that some use of graphics applications as tools for learning (I am not talking about producing art on computer) could help in reducing the learning time for the concepts that are learned by observation alone.</p>

<p>I would like to give some pointers for some freely available (open-source) graphics programs that I found quite interesting.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> is a modeling software. I warn that it has a steep learning curve, but I believe it won’t be that much of a problem for trying out a composition of basic shapes and lighting.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.dedalo-3d.com/">Makehuman</a> is a program for modeling 3d humanoid characters. I warn that the quality of models produced is far below the standards found in classical paintings. However, this is the best way of producing some forms and posing them the way you want quickly. While this cannot replace live models, it does give us an easy way of trying different poses quickly. It could serve as preliminary homework, before actual live model sessions, and probably an easy way to decide on a new pose that we expect from the model.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> is a 2D drawing program. The advantage I see here is the ability to ‘modify’ the lines in our line drawing !!. We normally draw lines and erase and draw new ones, if we are not satisfied with curvature. However, if we have the ability to modify the curvature interactively, it could serve as a good tool for learning the aspects of line shapes and curvatures.</li>
