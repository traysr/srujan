  <p><em>Update: The article was written before iBooks 2 was released. Many things I wish here are already available in iBooks 2</em></p>

<p>With the advent of iPad, many people are finding a comfortable way for reading e-books. There are many good apps for the books, such as Kindle, B&amp;N reader and Apple’s own iBooks. These apps present content in nice, readable fonts, have great page flip animations and bookmark and markup tools. However I am not very impressed by them as they seem to ignore the processing power of the computer sitting below their virtually rendered page. The current state of apps is sufficient for fiction books, but I believe they could do much more for reference books, and could possibly give a much better user-exeperience than reading wikipedia or traditional reference books. Let me explain how.</p>

<p>Most of the information available on the internet as we know is in a non-linear format. More precisely it is a network of information with each piece pointing to each other through hyperlinks. All the pieces of information are also searchable, either by global search engines such as google, or local searches within a website, like the wikipedia search. This type of format has value of being quickly accessible and easy to navigate. However, there is another format that we are more used to, and that is the linear format of books. I believe the linear format has its own value, and so a hybrid format, where non-linear information can be mapped into a linear format quickly for reading purpose, is likely going to be much more useful than the linear and non-linear format themselves. An ideal app for reference book should be able to transform information according to user preference and present it back in linear format – something like re-arranging the pages – because I believe, finally the linear format is more comfortable for long reading. I will explain this app with an example of a reference book on art-history.</p>

<p>A typical art-history book, contains a database of information arranged in linear fashion for simplicity. Typically, the art-movements form the larger sections of the book and are arranged chronologically. Each section has a list of artists arranged either by their importance, or alphabetically. Each artist’s section contains his/her biography and pictures of his/her artwork. I do enjoy reading these books in the order that they are presented. However, many times, I wish I could change the order. Sometimes I am interested in going backwards from recent artists to more ancient. Sometimes I just prefer a random order. Sometimes I prefer artists in order of their importance globally (not necessary in their art-movements). Sometimes I would just prefer seeing all the paintings at a time in the order of their importance. Another aspect that I always imagine would be helpful, would be to see all the paintings set on a same page with their image dimensions proportional to their real dimensions, so that one can have a better idea about how the artworks relate to each other in size. I am comfortable with reading dimensions of paintings in both metric as well as english system, but some might prefer one system over another.</p>

<p>I believe all of the above can be achieved on a tablet. It won’t take much time for a tablet to rearrange the chapters and still maintain a good layout (take <a href="http://www.flipboard.com">Flipboard</a> as an example, for how a good layout can be created with dynamic content). Today, there are a few apps on iPad about art-history, but they present data in a fixed format. The good art-history app should present it as a book, but allow the user to rearrange the pages according to his/her preference. In-fact there is no need for a separate app for each reference book. I believe all types of reference books share some formating and layout principles. It would be more better if there is a single reference books app, that can download these smart-books on demand. Each smart-book should have its own content and code to reformat it according to user choice. The programming can be done in javascript for example, which can drive the page layout. Javascript can possibly layout the native user-interface elements and not just the web elements, as is seen <a href="http://will.thimbleby.net/scripting-with-javascript-in-cocoa/">here</a>.</p>
