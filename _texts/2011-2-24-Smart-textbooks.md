_Update: The article was written before iBooks 2 was released. Many things I wish here are already available in iBooks 2_

Continuing my discussion on [Smart books](/smartbooks) for reference books on iPad, here is a possible user experience for Smart-textbooks on iPad.

Textbooks on iPad, or any other tablet should not simply copy the current user experience of traditional textbooks. If they can work around the limitations of traditional textbooks, they would be much more valuable.

A textbook, typically contains two main elements: Text and graphics. The graphics comes in wide variety of types such as figures, diagrams, images, charts, maps etc. The static graphics in a text book is merely a limitation of traditional media. The learning experience of text and graphics is usually enhanced by a teacher/professor who uses everything from hand-gestures, teaching-aids, experiments, slides, videos etc to convey the concepts to the students. It is at this point that smart-textbooks could become a valuable teaching/learning aid and go beyond the role of traditional textbooks.

Here are some thoughts:

**Image sequences** : It is quite often in the process of learning, that we are interested in a sequence of steps in which an idea is developed. This could be step by step derivation of a mathematical formula or a sequence of figures illustrating a dynamic concept (caterpillar morphing into a butterfly for example). Most of the times this is illustrated using sequence of images. A teacher usually works out a formula or image sequence on blackboard. An iPad could be a good device to show this image sequence as an ‘animation’ and could provide a more clearer understanding of how the images are transforming in the sequence, since the new image will be animated in same position as original. This part is very difficult to illustrate using an image sequence in traditional textbook and carries the limitation of the number of images in a sequence which is kept low to occupy less space.

**Parameter dependency** : There are many times we need to illustrate how certain parameters depend on each other (for example, the volume, pressure and temperature of a gas). This type of interdependency can be better explained by letting the student ‘play’ with the parameters. This could be done in simple way by providing sliders for each parameter that change when one of the parameter is changed, or it could be done in a more detailed and elegant way by showing an interactive figure where the user visually sees changes in values. (For example, a piston that the student can interact with to see the change in pressure or temperature that can be indicated by color/opacity of the gas)

**video clips** : Short video clips of either the real world events, or a graphics illustration of events, are very helpful while learning events or phenomenon. This is not a new concept, and is already used as a teaching aid. However, the videos embedded inside a textbook would be more useful than the ones shown outside of a textbook. The same goes for audio. There are certain places where audio is absolutely necessary (music theory for example), while there are other places where audio can be an additional aid while learning a visual change that the student sees in the tools explained earlier (image sequences, parameter dependency)

**Maps over time** : Maps provide a very good aid when learning different events in history. However, many times, the map itself is changing as the events unfold (map of german occupation during WWII for example). Typically this is shown using sequence of maps. The map sequences have same limitations as image sequences. There are only a limited number of maps, at a limited amount of detail that can be shown in a textbook. However, if the map can be animated over time using a slider and can be zoomed/panned similar to google-maps, we should be able to fit a larger detail and more sequences in a given time.

**Smooth zooming** : The smooth tile-based zooming that we see in case of google maps need not be limited to maps. This type of nearly infinite zooming can help concepts like moving from a tissue to a nucleus of a cell in a smooth fashion, or for zooming out from earth level to a galaxy level. The smooth zoom is an important visual aid, and it will be more useful if it is interactive, as opposed to a video.

**Experiments** : Lab simulations could provide a very good aid during classroom learning. Although nothing can replace a real experience gained in a lab, the simulations could be a good aid for certain experiments that cannot be performed because either they are too dangerous or are impossible due to some logistical constraints. A dissection of a frog for example, can be simulated in a very nice fashion with the multi-touch iPad. Similarly, there are a number of chemistry and physics experiments that I think can be simulated very well on iPad.

**Continuity between content** : One of the constraint of textbook is that it is divided by grades. However, the knowledge gained in different grades is a continues process and cannot be divided into physical sections. While we might expect a student to be confident about the knowledge gained in earlier grades, it doesn’t practically happen. I have found myself, scrambling to find information in earlier textbooks that I have gotten rid of. Typically a smart-textbook should be a single textbook spanning across multiple grades, giving the opportunity for student to look behind or peek ahead and not limited to his grade. Having a continues textbook also gives the flexibility to a school to decide what is the demarcation for a particular grade.

**In-line answers** : There are other simple enhancements that can be done to a textbook and are somewhat related to my earlier article about _smart books_. While there is not much scope for re-arrangement of content since the content follows a fixed linear path, it could be helpful to do things like hiding all the exercises for smooth reading, or provide the answers to exercises in-line with the questions when requested, so that one doesn’t have to peek into the back of the book for answers when one is really interested in seeing the answers. Simple objective tests that can test your knowledge and give instant results could be another learning aid while preparing for the exams. These aids become more valuable when embedded inside a textbook, rather than as a separate activity.

Video out : The video-out through a VGA-adapter for the ipad can serve as a very good teaching tool if the textbook apps can show content on the separate screen (typically a projector). This can greatly enhance the experience of image-sequences, videos, experiment simulations etc described above.
