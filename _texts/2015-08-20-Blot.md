I have moved the site to [Blot.im](http://blot.im). I was [experimenting](/JekyllRedesign) with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) earlier and then wanted to maintain my blog on Github via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

However, _Blot_ makes things easier. You can put your markdown or text files in a subfolder on dropbox (a folder dedicated to Blot app) and the files get published automatically.

I know there are scripts available on the internet, that can do the same stuff. However, it is much better if somebody else is maintaining those scripts as we discover new defects or want to add more features. Github based publishing is also good, but the instant gratification given by editing the code on your own machine and not having to push/commit it, can only be appreciated after being experienced.

I had to fix some spelling errors in the posts yesterday. All I had to do is edit the file already sitting there in my sublime text, press `⌘ + S`, then `⌘ + R` to refresh the browser, and the changes were there. That experience is priceless.
